Hello, my name is Amir Arsalan Saadatfar.😄
I work in the world of technology, including operating systems.
I created a team called BitQ, of course I am alone and there is only one member of this team. 😊
I spent 7 months trying to build an OS.💻⚙

Now I have created an operating system called Melan OS, which I have not published anywhere and which still needs to be created. Because for now, the interface has been created, but it does not have hardware or a kernel, and it has been created separately and may be released in 2027.🌐🛠

Support me financially and in my efforts to develop this operating system, and we will help it develop even beyond Ubuntu and Fedora.🖥💻🔍🪙📌
